Functionalities like spell checking are quite important, especially I mostly write stuff in my non-native languages. This article covers, hopefully, every aspect of proofreading LaTex and Markdown in Vim. Vim spell checking Vim itself has already a fully functioning spell checker, see :h spell for more details.
